### NOTES:

- When a number is divided by `n`, then the remainders are in the range `0` to `n-1`. 
    - For example, when a number is divided by `2`, the remainders can be `0` or `1`. 
    - In case a number is divided by `4`, then the remainders are in the range `0` to `3`.
- A number is said to be an even number when it is divisible by `2`. 
    - That means, when a number gives remainder `0` on division by `2`, it's an even number.
    - That also means that odd numbers give `1` as remainder on division by `2`.
