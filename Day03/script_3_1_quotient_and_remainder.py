# Find the quotient and remainder on dividing 37 with 4.

# Sample Ouptut:
'''
On the dividing 37 with 4 the result is as follows:
Quotient = 9
Remainder = 1
'''

dividend = 37
divisor = 4
quotient = dividend // divisor
remainder = dividend - quotient * divisor

print ("On dividing 37 with 4 the result is as follows:")
print ("Quotient =", quotient)
print ("Remainder =", remainder)
